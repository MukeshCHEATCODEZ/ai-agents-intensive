# 🧠 5-Day AI Agents Intensive — Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive** by **Google DeepMind** and **Kaggle**.
This repo documents my hands-on learning, projects, and experiments while building **AI-powered agents** using Python and Kaggle Notebooks.

---

## 📅 Daily Progress

### 🧩 **Day 1: From Prompt to Action + Agent Architectures**

* Learned how AI agents interpret prompts and perform actions.
* Understood the structure of **single** and **multi-agent systems**.
* Explored basic agent workflows and execution pipelines.

### ⚙️ **Day 2: Agent Tools & Best Practices**

* Built agents that interact with **external tools and APIs**.
* Created a **simulated Image Generation Agent** that handles single and bulk requests.
* Explored MCP (Model Context Protocol) and its role in agent communication.

### 🧠 **Upcoming: Day 3 - State and Memory Management**

* Will explore how agents retain, recall, and utilize memory for complex reasoning tasks.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python
* **Tools:** Kaggle Notebooks, Google AI Studio, MCP, ADK Toolkit
* **Concepts:** Agentic Architecture, Function Tools, Tool Wrappers, Context Handling

---

## 🚀 Goals

* Build a production-ready AI Agent by the end of the 5 days.
* Compete in the **Kaggle x Google AI Agents Challenge** 🏆
* Document and share every learning step to help others follow along.
